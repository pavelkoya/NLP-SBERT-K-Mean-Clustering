Topic Modeling using K-Means Clustering in NLP

To implement K-Means clustering for topic modeling on a collection of text data, grouping similar documents based on their content.

Given a large collection of articles or text documents, it becomes challenging to manually classify them by topic. By using K-Means clustering, we aim to automatically group similar documents together, identifying underlying topics and trends.

1. Data Preprocessing:
	•	Text Cleaning: Remove stop words, punctuation, convert text to lowercase, and remove non-alphabetic characters.
	•	Tokenization and Lemmatization: Break down text into tokens and reduce them to their root form.
	•	Vectorization: Convert text into numerical format using methods like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Count Vectorizer.

2.	K-Means Clustering:
	•	Choose the number of clusters (K) using methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.
	•	Apply K-Means clustering to the vectorized text data.
